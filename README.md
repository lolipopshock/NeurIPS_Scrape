# NeurIPS_Scrape

The NeurIPS workshop schedule page is not ideally clean and easy to use. Therefore, I tried to scrape the workshop information and organize them in an better way. 

The code in `Scrape NeurIPS Workshop.ipynb` is simple and only uses `BeautifulSoup`, `Requests` and `Re`. Additionally, [`tqdm`](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) is used for timing the scraping. 

You can directly manipulate the JSON data in `workshop_info.json`, or you can view the organized workshop information in this [notion page](https://www.notion.so/shannonrosen/2019-NeurIPS-Workshop-Detailed-Info-356c490d9c15438bba75635b11190ecc). 

Hope this can be useful to you.
